# Autónomo - Complete Guide [3.1]

**EN** | [UA]({{site.baseurl }}/ua/) | [RU]({{ site.baseurl }}/ru/)

The document contains all the necessary information for registering and managing an autónomo in Spain: instructions,
lifehacks and useful tips.

The information has been collected for almost a year by me, members of
the [IT Autonomos](https://bit.ly/it-autonomos-es){:target="_blank"} community, and through consultations with gestors.
The document is regularly **reviewed by gestors** and frequently
updated ([GitHub repository](https://bit.ly/it-autonomos-github){:target="_blank"}).

If you want to learn about the history of this document, or thank me for my work, check out
the [secret section](#secret-section).
