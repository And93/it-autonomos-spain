## After registration (mandatory)

1. Obtain an electronic certificate (or Cl@ve PIN)

   This can be done at any time, even before registering as an autónomo (but it's better not to delay).

   An electronic certificate can be obtained in several ways. I did it here, for
   free: [https://certificadoelectronico.es/](https://certificadoelectronico.es/){:target="_blank"} (it took a few
   minutes, and I didn't have to go anywhere).
   This certificate has the same legal force as a certificate issued by FNMT. If you need it urgently, you can pay extra
   on this site for express service, and the certificate will be made the same day.

   Cl@ve PIN is easiest to obtain when you already have an electronic certificate. Cl@ve PIN is not mandatory, but I
   think it might be more convenient to use some services in Spain with it. I have it.

2. Check that the correct IBAN of the account from which payments for Seguridad Social will be debited is indicated on
   the Seguridad Social portal.

3. Download Modelo 036
   [according to this instruction](https://www.xolo.io/es-en/faq/xolo-spain/category/get-started/article/i-am-already-registered-as-self-employed-where-can-i-find-my){:

4. Go to your bank and provide Modelo 036 in electronic form.

5. Create a client in the Xolo dashboard (take the data from your contract, if you have several contracts - you need to
   create several clients).

6. [Upload invoices to the Xolo dashboard](#tax-deductions-and-benefits) that you want to deduct from taxes (this will
   need to be done regularly). If you do not plan to deduct anything, then you do not need to upload anything.

7. [Create an invoice in the Xolo dashboard](#how-to-create-an-invoice-in-xolo) (this will need to be done regularly).
