### Getting a plastic SIP for yourself

If you do not have a permanent plastic SIP, you can get one after registering as an autónomo.

It was very simple for me, a few days after registering as an autónomo, I received an sms that I was issued a plastic
SIP. Then I went to my Centro de Salud (where I previously issued a paper SIP) and exchanged the paper SIP for a plastic
one in 2 minutes.

A more manual and alternative approach is to obtain a certificate of entitlement to medical care (derecho de asistencia
sanitaria) [here](https://pssc.seg-social.es/pssc-app-estructurados/asistencia){:target="_blank"}. It is better to ask
in the chat how exactly to get it (I do not duplicate this instruction here because it is quite large). Also, print the
empadronamiento from the ayuntamiento website. Then come to the Centro de Salud, which refers to your address, show all
these documents there, and get a plastic SIP card.
