## Creating an invoice (Xolo)

- If you plan to issue invoices in currencies other than euros, read about [invoice currency](#invoice-currency).
- To understand the best day to create invoices, read about [invoice date](#invoice-date).

Before you create your first invoice, you need to [create a client in the Xolo dashboard](#creating-a-client).

Creating an invoice:

1. Income tab -> New Sales Invoice.
2. Invoice date: the last day of the month for which you are issuing the invoice (e.g., January 31).
3. Due date: can be set 10 days after the invoice date.
4. Description: "Software development services in 1-Jan-24 - 31-Jan-24" (my personal example).
5. Quantity: can be left as is, 1 pc.
6. Price: the amount you should be paid for the services.
7. Comments, interest, discount: do not fill in.
8. Send the completed invoice.
