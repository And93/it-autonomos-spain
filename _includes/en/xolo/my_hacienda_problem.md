## My problem with the Spanish tax office

I want to share my personal experience with an issue I had with the Spanish tax office and how Xolo helped me resolve
it. When I was registering as an aut贸nomo, I also decided to immediately register for an EU VAT number, as indicated in
my guide.

A few days after registering as an aut贸nomo, I received a letter from the tax office at the Correos branch (I even had
to sign for it upon receipt). The letter stated that I had 10 days to provide the missing information, otherwise, I
would face a fine.

For me, as someone who had just registered as an aut贸nomo, this was stressful - I had just started, and something was
already wrong. I immediately took a photo of the letter and sent it to Xolo support. They responded very quickly, within
just a couple of hours, and said they would take care of the issue and handle all further communication with the tax
office. I asked them to keep me informed because I was worried about the day deadline. They assured me that they were
in full control of the situation, and I wouldn't have to do anything. Xolo sent all the necessary documents to the tax
office, and within a few days, the issue was completely resolved, and my EU VAT number was registered. After that, the
tax office had no further claims against me.

I was pleased that I didn't have to deal with this issue on my own. I just took a photo of the letter, sent it to
support, and within a few days, everything was resolved.

This story shouldn't scare you or stop you from registering for an EU VAT number when registering as an aut贸nomo. I
still recommend doing it right away. My case was an exception, and I haven't heard of anyone else having similar
problems. If you have interesting personal cases with issues with the tax office, share them in the chat - it could be
helpful for others.
