## Risk of losing the Seguridad Social discount

Be sure to check whether the correct IBAN of your bank account is indicated in the Seguridad Social portal. It is from
this account that [social contributions](#social-contributions-seguridad-social) will be deducted.

You can check it here:
[Tesorería General de la Seguridad Social](https://portal.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/importass/importass/bienvenida){:
target="_blank"} (ver tus datos de autonomo -> Domiciliación bancaria)

Always keep enough money in the account from which payments for Seguridad Social are deducted. If there is not enough
money when trying to make a withdrawal, you may lose the discount for the month when the payment for Seguridad Social
could not be deducted the first time. Also, there is a risk of a fine.

The discount for Seguridad Social is valid for 12 months after registering as an autónomo. If you close your autónomo
within 12 months, you will not be able to activate the discount again within 3 years after closing your autónomo.

I have also heard that many people face issues with the payment deduction in the first month. Therefore, check
everything in advance.
