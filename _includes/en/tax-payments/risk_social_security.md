## Risk of losing the Seguridad Social discount

**You can check the IBAN in your Seguridad Social account here:**
[Tesorería General de la Seguridad Social](https://portal.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/importass/importass/bienvenida){:
target="_blank"} (Entrar en tu área personal -> ver tus datos de autonomo -> Domiciliación bancaria). Ensure that the correct
IBAN is listed in your Seguridad Social account, as social contributions will be deducted from this account.

It is important to always maintain a sufficient balance in the account. If there are insufficient funds at the time of
withdrawal, you may lose the social contribution discount for the current month. Additionally, there is a risk of a fine
for non-payment.

In the first month, many people encounter issues with the deduction of funds. Therefore, it is better to check
everything in advance to avoid any problems.

Be sure to read the section on [social contributions](#social-contributions-seguridad-social), which details potential
issues and important points.
