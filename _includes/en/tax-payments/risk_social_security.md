## Risk of losing the Seguridad Social discount

**Check the IBAN in the Seguridad Social account here:**
[Tesorería General de la Seguridad Social](https://portal.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/importass/importass/bienvenida){:
target="_blank"} (Entrar en tu área personal -> ver tus datos de autonomo -> Domiciliación bancaria).

Make sure that the correct IBAN is indicated in your Seguridad Social account,
as [social contributions](#social-contributions-seguridad-social) will be deducted from this account.

It is important to always maintain a sufficient balance in the account. If there are insufficient funds at the time of
the withdrawal attempt, you may lose the discount on social security contributions for the current month. In addition,
there is a risk of a fine for non-payment.

The Seguridad Social discount is provided for 12 months after registering as an autónomo. If you stop your activity
before the end of this period, it will be impossible to reactivate the discount for 3 years.

In the first month, many face issues with the withdrawal of funds. Therefore, it is better to check everything in
advance to avoid problems.
