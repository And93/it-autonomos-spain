## Risk of losing the Seguridad Social discount

**Check the IBAN in the Seguridad Social account here:**
[Tesorería General de la Seguridad Social](https://portal.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/importass/importass/bienvenida){:
target="_blank"} (Entrar en tu área personal -> ver tus datos de autonomo -> Domiciliación bancaria).

Make sure that the correct IBAN of your bank account is indicated in the Seguridad Social
account. [Social contributions](#social-contributions-seguridad-social) will be debited from this account.

Always keep enough money in the account. If there is insufficient money when attempting to withdraw, you may lose the
social security discount for the month in which the money could not be debited on the first attempt. There is also a
risk of a fine.

The Seguridad Social discount is valid for 12 months after registering as autónomo. If you close the autónomo status
within 12 months, you will not be able to activate the discount again for 3 years after closing.

I’ve also heard that many people have issues with the first month's payment. Therefore, check everything in advance.
