# Gestor or Xolo?

I decided to register and manage my autónomo through
the [Xolo](https://bit.ly/xolosignup){:target="_blank"} service instead of an
individual gestor.
The platform completely replaces the gestor, and in my opinion, it is even
better.

- Subscription costs 71 EUR/month (gestors charge 75-110 EUR/month).
- Registration of autónomo - free (gestors charge 0-150 EUR).
- Registration of EU VAT - free (gestors charge 0-150 EUR).
- A large team of gestors with experience in servicing 100,000 autónomos.
- Support in English and Spanish responds quickly.
- All communication with the tax authorities is conducted by the service
  (tested personally).
- No need to provide your electronic key, which is safer. The service submits
  reports using its own keys.
- The service is responsible for errors in reporting.
- Convenient dashboard for income/tax statistics, tax deductions, invoices,
  and notifications.
- Cooperation agreement with the Agencia Tributaria (Spanish Tax Agency).
- Xolo does not support [Autónomo Colaborador](#autónomo-colaborador).
- [Will Xolo suit you if you are not in IT](#is-xolo-suitable-for-you-if-you-are-not-from-it).

Register using the **[referral link](https://bit.ly/xolosignup){:target="

If you are already using the services of a gestor but want to switch to Xolo,
register using the link above and click “I am already an autónomo”.
