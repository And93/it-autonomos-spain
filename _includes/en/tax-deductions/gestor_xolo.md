## Gestor/Xolo

If you have an individual [gestor](#reliable-gestors), they will deduct the expenses for their services from your taxes (just confirm with
your gestor to be sure).

If you use Xolo, they automatically deduct the expenses for the monthly subscription (this is visible in the dashboard).
