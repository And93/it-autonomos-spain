## Fee for transfer to a bank account

If you receive money via an international SWIFT transfer (for example, one of my clients sends money from the USA to my
account in a Spanish bank), a commission may be charged for this transfer (around 20-30 euros).

This commission can also be deducted from taxes, amounting to several hundred euros a year.

To deduct this from taxes, you need to provide your gestor or Xolo with a bank statement indicating the commission for
the transfer.
