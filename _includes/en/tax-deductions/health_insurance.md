## Medical insurance

You can deduct expenses for health insurance (500 euros per year for yourself and the same amount for family members
under 25 years old).

I do not deduct this because I only use public healthcare in Spain (healthcare here is one of the best in the world).

To deduct this from taxes, you need to provide your gestor or Xolo with a full invoice (with your NIE, full name, and
aut√≥nomo registration address).
