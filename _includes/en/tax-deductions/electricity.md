## Electricity

If the contract with the electricity provider is not signed by you, you will not be able to deduct these expenses. In my
experience, the procedure for transferring the contract is quite simple (just contact support, and they will help you do
it).

To deduct this from taxes, you need to provide your gestor or Xolo with a full invoice (with your NIE, full name, and
aut√≥nomo registration address).
