## Other professional expenses

You can deduct other expenses related to professional activities from your taxes.

For example:

- Subscription to the IDE you use (e.g., IntelliJ);
- Subscription to ChatGPT (if used for work);
- Training courses;
- And many others, as long as you can justify them.

An important point is that all these expenses must be necessary for your professional activity.

To deduct this from taxes, you need to provide your gestor or Xolo with a full invoice (with your NIE, full name, and
aut√≥nomo registration address).
