## Rent

If you want to deduct part of the rent from taxes as expenses for your autónomo, this must be permitted by your lease
agreement.

It is necessary to carefully read the agreement and ensure there is no clause prohibiting economic activity in the
residential space. If such a clause exists, you can sign an additional agreement with the landlord (as I did) allowing
economic activity.

Formula for calculating the deduction amount:  
_[rental cost in euros] × 30% × [% of the apartment used for economic activity]_

Step-by-step instructions:

1. Analyze the lease agreement for a clause prohibiting economic activity. For this, you can use ChatGPT, contact your
   gestor or Xolo.
2. If the lease prohibits economic activity, ask for an amendment to allow it (usually a paid but inexpensive service).
3. Sign the amendment to the contract (for example, using an electronic signature on a computer).
4. Send the document to your landlord for their signature.
5. Send the signed amendment to the gestor so they can consider it for future rent deductions.
6. Each month, provide a bank statement showing the rent payment to your gestor or upload it to the Xolo dashboard (an
   invoice is not required, just the statement).

Don't invent reasons why the landlord might refuse to sign the additional agreement - just ask them. Often, people make
assumptions without checking, thereby missing the opportunity to save money.
