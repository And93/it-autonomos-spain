# Tax deductions and benefits

The tax deduction mechanism in Spain allows an autónomo to reduce their taxable base by including certain expenses
related to professional activity (e.g., office rent, purchase of equipment, service subscriptions).

To deduct expenses, it is necessary to provide full invoices (indicating your NIE, name, and autónomo
registration address) to your gestor or upload them to the Xolo dashboard. In rare cases, bank statements may be
acceptable instead of full invoices (this is specified separately below). It is recommended to provide invoices for your
expenses in Spanish. This will help avoid potential difficulties during tax inspections. If invoices are in another
language, they may need to be translated into Spanish in the event of an audit.

If you use professional services (such as lawyers, consultants, engineers, and other specialists) or rent a commercial
property, you will be issued invoices that may include retentions (retenciones) at rates of 7%, 15%, or 19%. Send these
invoices to your gestor or Xolo on time to avoid penalties for delayed registration.

Some believe it is not worth bothering with tax deductions, thinking the amounts are small. From my experience, aside
from direct savings, there may be other positive side effects. For example, after I transferred the electricity contract
to my name, I also decided to switch to a more favorable tariff (this became easier to do because the contract was now
under my name). As a result, monthly expenses decreased from 180-200 euros to 100-120 euros per month (almost half). Add
the tax deductions to this.

Below is a list of expenses that I deduct from taxes or know about. Feel free to share your experiences in the chat if
you have something to add.
