## Liability in case of error

A good gestor should have liability insurance in case, for example, they make a mistake in reporting. If this
mistake leads to financial damage (e.g. fines), the insurance should cover the damage. Such insurance may include a
deductible (around 200-300 euros). Therefore, in practice, a responsible gestor, if they make a mistake that causes
minor damage (within 200-300 euros), will simply cover this damage out of their own pocket.
