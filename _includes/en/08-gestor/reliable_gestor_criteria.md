## Criteria for a reliable gestor

- Adequate communication and prompt response to requests. It sounds basic, but if your communication is slow and
  problematic from the start, it's a reason to think (likely, there will be issues in the future as well).
- Capable of correctly registering an autonomo so that there are no fines or problems.
- Properly registers with both the social security system and the tax office (during autonomo registration).
- Does not require providing your personal electronic certificate (instead, uses their own electronic certificate to
  file reports and for other operations).
- Comfortable communication channels (usually email, WhatsApp).
- Periodically provides reports so that you know how much tax you will need to pay and how much money to keep in your
  account.
- Handles communication with all government agencies directly.
- Monitors notifications from the tax office and other government bodies.
- Has insurance in case of their own mistake.
