## Banks and tax reporting

In Spain, taxes are only paid on deposits for which you provide an invoice to the tax authorities (for autónomo income).
Therefore, the account in a Spanish bank where you receive autónomo payments can also be used for personal expenses.
It’s not a problem if a friend transfers you 100 euros for lunch - you won’t need to pay taxes on such payments.

All banks report information on all your accounts to the tax authorities. It doesn’t matter if the account is used for
autónomo activities or personal needs. If a significant discrepancy is observed between income and expenses across all
accounts, this could attract the attention of the tax authorities.

If, as an autónomo, you decide to receive autónomo income on one account and other payments on a separate account (in a
different bank), keep in mind that the tax authorities will see all transactions. Additionally, I recommend avoiding
frequent transfers from friends via Bizum when possible.
