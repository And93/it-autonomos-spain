## Why you need a Spanish bank account

Regardless of whether you receive payments for services to a Spanish account or to a foreign bank/payment system, you 
**must** have an account in a Spanish bank. First, a Spanish account is required for aut√≥nomo registration. Second,
payments for [Seguridad Social](#social-contributions-seguridad-social) and [IRPF](#irpf-income-tax) will be deducted
directly from a Spanish account.
