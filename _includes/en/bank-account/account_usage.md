## Taxation and account usage

In Spain, you need to pay taxes only for those credits to the account for which you
provide an invoice for the tax agency.

Also, for the tax agency, there are no problems if you receive payments not to
an account in a Spanish bank, but for example, to Wise or Revolut.

You can use your personal account or a joint account with your spouse in a Spanish bank to receive payments
as an autónomo. The convenience of a joint account is that you can both spend
money from it.

The account to which you receive payments as an autónomo (in a Spanish bank) can also
be used for personal expenses. Also, there are no problems
if your friend transfers you 100 euros for a dinner at a restaurant to this same account
(no taxes need to be paid on this receipt). You will need to pay taxes only on autónomo receipts.

If desired, you can use different accounts for autónomo and for personal needs.

You do not need to open any special account for autónomo. You need to
open a regular personal account in a Spanish bank and when opening it,
say that you do not conduct any economic activity in
Spain, and you do not have any work here at all. And already after
you open this account and register autónomo, you will need to
bring the relevant documents to the bank, and they will make the necessary changes on their side
(more details about this in other steps of the autónomo registration).
