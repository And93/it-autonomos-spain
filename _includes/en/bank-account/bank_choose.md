## Choosing a bank

It is recommended to use one of the Spanish
banks [approved by the Spanish Tax Authority](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/deudas-apremios-embargos-subastas/pagar-aplazar-consultar/listado-entidades-bancarias-adheridas.html?faqId=c2018148e27c2710VgnVCM100000dc381e0aRCRD){:

Initially, I used Santander, but later switched to CaixaBank (when I **obtained a mortgage**,

I don’t have specific recommendations on Spanish banks. Remember, large banks will always have both positive and
negative reviews from customers. For example, I was completely satisfied with Santander’s services, but I know people
who encountered real issues and were unhappy.

The main point is to choose a bank where the fees and terms suit you.

I do not recommend opening an account at a central branch, as the managers there may have a heavy workload. The optimal
choice is to open an account at a branch on the city outskirts and establish a connection with a manager (for instance,
my manager responds quickly to WhatsApp messages).
