## Choosing a bank

You must have an account in a Spanish bank because taxes and social payments will be debited from there.

It is recommended to use
banks [approved by the Spanish tax authorities](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/deudas-apremios-embargos-subastas/pagar-aplazar-consultar/listado-entidades-bancarias-adheridas.html?faqId=c2018148e27c2710VgnVCM100000dc381e0aRCRD){:

Many use Spanish banks Santander or BBVA, but you can use other banks as well. Personally, I use Santander.
