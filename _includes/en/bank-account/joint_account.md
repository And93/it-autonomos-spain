## Joint account

It is not recommended to use a joint account with your spouse for receiving autónomo payments. Technically, it’s
possible, but there are minimal risks, such as a banking error that might cause your spouse’s NIE to be listed as the
primary account holder instead of yours. Additionally, if you have separate property arrangements, a joint account
cannot be used.

However, I personally use this option and receive payments into a joint account because it’s more convenient for me.
Technically, it’s allowed, but it’s important to be aware of the potential risks.
