## Dedicated account for autónomo

If it’s more convenient for you, you can open a separate account specifically for autónomo activities. However, this is
not required. You can use your primary personal account for both receiving autónomo payments and for personal
expenses - that’s what I do.

If your business involves numerous daily banking transactions, it will definitely be more convenient for you to open a
separate account.

Some banks may offer special accounts for autónomo with unique rates. However, an autónomo account and a regular
personal account differ only in how the bank classifies them (for the tax authorities, they are simply personal
accounts). In Spain, the approach to account usage is different from, for example, Ukraine, where a dedicated account is
required for business activities.
