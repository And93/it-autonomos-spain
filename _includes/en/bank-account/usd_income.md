## Receiving income in USD

In this case, besides an account in a Spanish bank, it would be more beneficial to additionally
open an account in Wise or Revolut. You can receive USD on this
account, then convert USD to EUR and transfer to an account in a Spanish bank.
Many in the chat recommend this option, as
receiving USD on an account in a Spanish bank is less advantageous (due to fees and/or
conversion rates).

**Revolut:** It is recommended to purchase a Revolut Premium subscription, as it will be
more profitable considering the reduced currency conversion fees.

**Wise:** The advantage of Wise is that the balance earns about 4% per annum.

Which of these options will be more beneficial for you, calculate personally
based on your salary, the amount you want to keep in
dollars/euros, where and why you will transfer money, etc.
