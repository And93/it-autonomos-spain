## Receiving income in USD (and other currencies besides EUR)

When receiving income in USD or other currencies (other than EUR), it may be more advantageous to open an account with
Wise, Revolut, or another payment system/bank. You can receive USD, for example, in this account, then convert it to EUR
and transfer it to a Spanish bank account. Many people recommend this approach, as receiving foreign currency in a
Spanish account is less favorable due to high fees and poor conversion rates. This method is entirely legal from the
perspective of the Spanish tax authorities.

**Revolut:** I recommend the Revolut Premium subscription, as it reduces currency conversion fees.

**Wise:** Its advantage is that the balance earns approximately 4% annual interest.

Which option is more beneficial depends on your salary, the amount you plan to keep in dollars/euros, and the transfers
you make.
