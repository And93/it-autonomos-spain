## Registration of Modelo 036 in the bank

After registering as an autónomo, you will need to register the Modelo 036 with your bank. This way, the bank will know
that you are now an autónomo and that you will be receiving transfers related to your economic activity into your
account.

In some banks, this can be done online (check with support). But I would recommend another method, which, in my opinion,
is more reliable. Visit the branch, send the Modelo 036 to your manager by email in electronic form, and wait for the
manager to enter the necessary data into the banking system. If you want, you can bring a printed document, and the
manager will scan it.

If you don't do this, there is a risk that the account could be blocked (there have been cases like this shared in the
chat).

It may happen that the manager refuses to enter the data from your Modelo 036 into the banking system (for example, they
might say: come to me when the first payment as an autónomo arrives). In this case, you must insist that the manager
does it right away.

After the manager has entered your data into the banking system, I recommend checking the status of your account in the
bank's app. There have been cases when the manager assured that everything was ready, but the client's information had
not been updated, and they had to go back to the bank.

How exactly to check the correct registration of the Modelo 036, ask your manager or bank support. An example for
Santander: Menu -> Personal Area -> Professional details -> CNAE/CNO business activity code (should be PROFESIONAL
LIBERAL O AUTÓNOMO), Last profession (should be your type of activity, for example, ACTIVIDADES DE PROGRAMACIÓN
INFORMÁTICA).
