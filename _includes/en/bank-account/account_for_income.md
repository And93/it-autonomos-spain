## Which account to use for receiving payments

To receive payments for autónomo services, you can use any bank or payment system in almost any country in the world
(such as Wise, Revolut, Payoneer, PayPal, and others). Accounting in Spain is based on what you declare, not on a
specific account where you receive payments.

If you plan to apply for financing from a Spanish bank in the future (for example, **a mortgage**,
[here you can read about my experience obtaining a mortgage for an autónomo](#obtaining-a-mortgage-in-spain-for-autónomo-my-experience-and-mistakes)),
it is better to receive payments directly into a Spanish bank account from the start.

There is always a possibility that, in the future, you may have to show your account transactions to the tax authorities
for the account where you receive autónomo payments (even if this is a foreign payment system or bank). With a Spanish
bank, the tax authorities will automatically see everything. With a foreign bank, if you have other deposits aside from
autónomo income, be prepared to explain the source of these deposits to the tax authorities.
