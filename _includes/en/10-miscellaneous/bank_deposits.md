## How much money can be deposited into a bank account?

This question is not directly related to autónomos, but it is often discussed in the chat.

Short answer: it is all individual. The smaller the amounts deposited into the account, the lower the chances that the
bank will require additional documents.

Everyone's experience is different and depends on the specific bank, branch, manager, and many other factors. In the
chat, there were mentions of people depositing 5-10 thousand euros at a time into accounts in Spanish banks without any
documents being required. But there were cases where accounts were blocked, although users could continue to make
transactions. In such cases, it was necessary to go to the bank and provide additional documents. There were even cases
where the bank requested documents after deposits of a few hundred euros, but this is more of an exception.

If you conduct economic activities in another country and do not have income in Spain, it is important to be cautious
with your answers when opening an account in a Spanish bank. For example, answering “yes” to the question “do you work?”
may increase the chances of account blocking or attract additional attention.

It is important to remember: the smaller the amounts you deposit into the account, the more spread out over time these
deposits are, and the less regular they appear, the less likely it is that problems will arise.
