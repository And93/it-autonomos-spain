## Creating an invoice (Xolo)

Before you create your first invoice, you need to [create a client in the Xolo dashboard](#creating-a-client).

I create invoices in the first days of the current month for the previous month. It is important to do this by the 4th
of the current month. For example, I create the invoice for January by February 4th.

If you do not manage to create the invoice by the 4th, create it with any date, and send a request to Xolo support to
correct the date. Also, if you make any mistakes (for example, indicate the wrong amount), you can also contact support
and they will fix everything. Please note that invoices and adjustments after the reporting period are not allowed. This
only works if the reporting period has not yet started (no later than 4th of January, April, July, October).

Creating an invoice:

1. Income tab -> New Sales Invoice.
2. Invoice date: the last day of the previous month (e.g., January 31).
3. Due date: can be set 10 days after the invoice date.
4. Description: "Software development services in 1-Jan-24 - 31-Jan-24".
5. Quantity: can be left as is, 1 pc.
6. Price: the amount you should be paid for the services.
7. Comments, interest, discount: do not fill in.
8. Send the completed invoice.
