### Social contributions (Seguridad Social)

These need to be paid regardless of whether the autónomo has income. So, if you lose your job, you will continue to pay
while you look for a new one.

The first year has a discount (you need to pay €86.66 per month). If you registered as an autónomo after the 1-st day
of the month, the first payment for social contributions will be less (for example, if you registered in the middle
of the month, then for the first month you will pay approximately €86.66/2 = €43.33).
