### Paying taxes for the entire year or from the date of aut贸nomo registration

When you register as an aut贸nomo, you become a tax resident from January 1st of the current year (even if you registered
as an aut贸nomo in December). This means you need to pay taxes in Spain on all income received since the beginning of the
year.

Some take the risk and do not declare their income before registering as an aut贸nomo (there is a risk that authorities
may later find out). Others honestly declare everything and pay taxes on previously earned income. It is better to
choose the option with the least risk.

Do not ask what specific risks are involved if you decide to hide your income from other countries since the beginning
of the year. It is known that many people do this, but no one can tell you exactly what risks there are for you
personally.
