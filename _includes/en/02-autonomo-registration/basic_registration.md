## Registration (basic)

1. Verify that you have [all the necessary documents](#necessary-documents-for-registering-an-autónomo).

2. [Open a bank account if you don't have one](#which-bank-account-and-which-bank-to-use).

3. Register using the **[referral link](https://bit.ly/xolo-signup-free-renta){:target="
   _blank"}** (50 € bonus to your account for registration):
    - Click the Sign Up button at the top right.
    - Choose the Global plan (59 euros + VAT) - this plan is necessary if
      your clients are outside Spain.
    - Check that the registration page has the section "We detected a
      referral code:" with the filled value.
    - Enter your first name, last name, email, phone number, click Sign Up -
      then a login link to the Xolo dashboard will be sent to your email.
    - Do you reside in Spain? (living here for more than 183 days in a year)
      or plan to be? - YES
    - Are you registered as an autónomo in Spain - NO
    - Do you plan to immediately have dependent employees (on payroll)? - NO
    - Do you have dependent employees (on payroll)? - NO
    - What is your expected annual income? - Any value, income may change
      over time (and this is normal for an autónomo).

4. Register autónomo through the Xolo dashboard:
    - Log in to the Xolo dashboard using the link sent to your email.
    - After logging in, click "Register as Autonomo".
    - Enter your Spanish phone number, then send the verification code.
    - Business activity - for most, "PROGRAMADORES Y ANALISTAS INFORMATICA
      (763)" will be suitable (but there are many other options in the list,
      choose what fits you).
    - Comments - can be left empty.
    - Tax country - Spain.
    - NIE and Citizenship - obviously, NIE and your citizenship.
    - Business address - the address where you will conduct economic
      activity (business address can be different from where you live, this
      is normal).
    - Referencia catastral - if there is a problem finding by address, you
      can find your building and apartment on the map here and copy the
      Referencia catastral -
      [Sede Electrónica del Catastro](https://www1.sedecatastro.gob.es/cartografia/mapa.aspx){:target="_blank"}.
    - Social Security Number - if you don't have an NSS, you need to check
      the box that you don't have it and fill in the data (you can check if
      you have it by logging in here -
      [Tesorería General de la Seguridad Social](https://portal.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/importass/importass/bienvenida){:
      target="_blank"}).
    - Parents' names - preferably as in the international passports.
    - Forecast of monthly income in EUR - put it as you see it now, income may vary in the future.
    - Forecast of monthly expenses in EUR - can be left empty. Personally, I
      did not know in advance what my expenses would be.
    - I will have customers outside Spain in the EU (for EU VAT
      registration). I recommend activating this item right away. This is in
      case you have clients in the EU, so you don't have to pay VAT. EU VAT
      registration takes 1 day.
    - I want to use 7% IRPF on invoices - if you don't have Spanish clients,
      you don't need to check this box (you can read more
      [here](https://www.xolo.io/es-en/faq/xolo-spain/category/platform/article/can-i-make-invoices-with-7-irpf-personal-income-tax-withhold){:
      target="_blank"}).
    - Work permit - your TIE (if you don't have a TIE, but have an NIE and
      Temporary protection, that is also enough; in our chat, there are successful cases of
      opening autónomo through Xolo with only NIE and Temporary protection).
    - I'd like to schedule my registration - if you want to register autónomo
      now but start activities later (e.g. in a couple of months). You can
      choose the date from which autónomo will be activated (in this case,
      you can save on social contributions if you register autónomo in
      advance).
    - Total m2 of the house - the exact value can be found
      here [Sede Electrónica del Catastro](https://www1.sedecatastro.gob.es/cartografia/mapa.aspx){:
      target="_blank"}.
    - Total m2 of working space - the area of your working space (e.g. the
      area of the room where you will work). Keep in mind that by law, you
      cannot use more than 30% of the apartment area for economic activity.
      The value you specify in this field will be taken into account when
      deducting apartment rental expenses from taxes (if you decide to deduct
      them).

5. Wait for confirmation letters and SMS from the tax office, social
   services (1-2 days).

*<u>After completing these steps - autónomo is successfully registered, and
you can start economic activities.</u>*
