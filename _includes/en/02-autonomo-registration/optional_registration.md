## Optional

What follows is not mandatory, but I highly recommend it. Some points relate to benefits you receive as an
autónomo. If you pay taxes, why not take advantage of these benefits?

1. Close a similar economic activity to Autónomo in another country, if it exists (for example, FOP in Ukraine).
    - It is advisable to consult a specialist to determine whether this should be done before or after registering the
      autónomo. Based on the experience of many, I can say that it would be logical to close such an economic activity
      in another country.
2. Download the document with your social security number (NSS) -
   [Tesorería General de la Seguridad Social](https://portal.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/importass/importass/bienvenida){:
   target="_blank"}.
    - I don't know how necessary it is. But I adhere to the approach of downloading and saving all
      documents so that they are easy to present if needed. I recommend you follow this approach as well.
2. [Get a plastic SIP card for yourself](#getting-a-plastic-sip-for-yourself).
3. [Get plastic SIP cards for family members](#getting-a-plastic-sip-for-family-members).
