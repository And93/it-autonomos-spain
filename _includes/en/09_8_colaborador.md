### Aut贸nomo Colaborador

Aut贸nomo Colaborador is a status granted to family members of an aut贸nomo who work in their business. Typically, this
status is used by spouses, children (over 16 years old), or parents. This status allows for tax optimization,
potentially reducing the tax burden.

It is important that the family member actually engages in professional activities in the business. Attempting to use
this status for fictitious tax optimization, when the spouse is not involved in the work, may raise questions from the
tax authorities.

The tax authorities may check whether the family member is truly engaged in professional activities. If it is found that
this is not the case, I do not know what problems may arise.

Personally, I decided not to use this scheme because my spouse does not engage in professional activities, but takes
care of the home and child. I do not know exactly what methods the tax authorities have to check whether the spouse is
engaged in professional activities or only helps around the house. But just because I do not know this, it does not mean
that the tax authorities do not have such capabilities.

Xolo's support response to the question of whether they plan to work with Colaborador: _We do not have plans to work
with Aut贸nomo Colaborador in the near future, unfortunately._
