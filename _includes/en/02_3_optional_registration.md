## Optional

What follows is not mandatory, but I highly recommend it. Some points relate to benefits you receive as an
autónomo. If you pay taxes, why not take advantage of these benefits?

1. Schedule a call with a Xolo employee for a presentation (wait for an email, the call is very useful, in English 
   or Spanish).

2. Download the document with your social security number (NSS) -
   [Tesorería General de la Seguridad Social](https://portal.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/importass/importass/bienvenida){:
   target="_blank"}. I don't know how necessary it is. But I adhere to the approach of downloading and saving all
   documents so that they are easy to present if needed. I recommend you follow this approach as well.

3. Wait for an SMS notifying you that your plastic SIP card is ready. Then you can go to your Centro de Salud, where you
   previously registered for SIP, and exchange the paper SIP for a permanent plastic one.

4. [Obtain plastic SIP cards for family members](#getting-a-plastic-sip-for-family-members).
