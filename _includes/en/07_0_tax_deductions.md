## Tax deductions and benefits

The tax deduction mechanism in Spain allows aut√≥nomos to reduce their tax base by certain expenses related to
professional activities, such as office rent, equipment, etc.

To deduct expenses, you need to upload invoices or bank statements to the Xolo dashboard (or provide them to your
gestor). In the case of Xolo, after uploading the documents to the dashboard, their gestors review them and then
approve or reject these documents.

Some people believe that it is not worth bothering with tax deductions, claiming that the amount is insignificant. From
my experience, as a side effect, after I transferred the electricity contract to myself, I also decided to switch to 
a cheaper tariff (this became easier to do since the contract is in my name). As a result, monthly expenses
decreased from 190-200 euros to approximately 90-100 euros per month (about half). Add tax deductions to this as well.

Below are the types of expenses that I deduct or know about. Share your experience in the chat if you know of anything
else.
