# Gestor or Xolo?

{% include en/00-exclusive-offer/0_xolo_exclusive_offer.md %}

I decided to register and manage my autónomo through the [Xolo](https://bit.ly/xolo-signup-free-renta){:target="_blank"} service
instead of an individual gestor. The platform completely replaces the gestor, and in my opinion, it is even better.

- Subscription costs 71 €/month (gestors up to 110 €/month).
- Registration of autónomo - free (gestors up to 150 €).
- Registration of EU VAT - free (gestors up to 150 €).
- A large team of gestors with experience in servicing 100,000 autónomos.
- Support in English and Spanish responds quickly.
- All communication with the tax authorities is conducted by the service (tested personally).
- No need to provide your electronic key, which is safer. The service submits reports using its own keys.
- The service is [responsible for errors](#responsibility-in-case-of-error) in reporting.
- [Convenient dashboard](#dashboard-demo-tutorials) for income/tax statistics, tax deductions, invoices, and
  notifications.
- Cooperation agreement with the Agencia Tributaria (Spanish Tax Agency).
- Xolo does not support [autónomo colaborador](#autónomo-colaborador).
- [Will Xolo suit you if you are not in IT](#is-xolo-suitable-for-you-if-you-are-not-from-it).

Register using the **[referral link](https://bit.ly/xolo-signup-free-renta){:target="_blank"}** (50 € bonus to your account for
registration).
