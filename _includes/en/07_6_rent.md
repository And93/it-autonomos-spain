### Rent

You can send your rental agreement to Xolo, and they will analyze it (for free) and tell you if you can deduct part of
the rent from your taxes. If your agreement prohibits this (as mine did), you can sign an addendum with
your landlord. Ask your landlord if they are okay with signing it - if they agree, ask Xolo to prepare the addendum (36
euros). In my case, the landlord was fine with it, so I signed the addendum to be able to deduct part of the rent from
taxes.

I strongly recommend not coming up with reasons why the landlord might object. Just ask, and that's it. I've heard
various speculations from some people about why the landlord might find it disadvantageous (and these people often don't
even ask, deciding for the landlord).

If you want to save 36 euros, you can make the addendum yourself in 15 minutes and send it to the landlord for signing.
In the attachment “Anexo contrato alquiler” below, I have included the document that Xolo made for me for 36 euros. You
can easily insert your own data into it. I would have been happy to save too if someone had shared this template with me
earlier :)

How much can you deduct? Xolo's formula is:

_[rent cost in euros] * 30% * [% of the apartment area used for economic activity]_

Approximate algorithm:

- Analyze your contract and find a clause prohibiting commercial activity (if there is one) - you can use ChatGPT for
  this. Or write to Xolo, send them your contract for analysis.
- If your contract prohibits commercial activity in rented housing, you need to sign an addendum to the contract to
  allow this activity.
- Make a PDF document using the template I have added in the attachment.
- Sign this PDF document (I used the signature on my MacBook).
- Send it to your landlord for their signature as well.
- Send the signed addendum to Xolo support, so they can record it and approve the deduction of rent expenses in the
  future.
- Each month, upload a bank statement showing the deduction for rent to the Xolo dashboard (an invoice is not needed,
  just the statement).
