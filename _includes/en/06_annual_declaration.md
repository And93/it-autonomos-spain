### Annual declaration

Modelo 100 is submitted once a year and is usually a separate paid service, both with gestors and Xolo (in some Xolo
subscriptions, this is included, and no additional payment will be required).

Xolo sends a large questionnaire in which you need to provide information about your family, children, and spouse, as
well as answer questions that affect the report calculation. This questionnaire needs to be filled out carefully and
sent back. Then, a manager is assigned to you who maintains contact, answers questions, and explains all the details.
The manager sends a draft report for review, which will include all calculations, discounts, and the final tax amount.
After your approval, the manager sends the documents to the relevant authorities and informs you of the tax deduction
date.

Later, the tax office should deduct the funds from the specified account (in case of underpayment of taxes), or vice
versa, refund the overpaid amounts. Ensure that the necessary amount is in the account, otherwise serious problems may
arise.
