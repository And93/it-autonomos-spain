### An obvious but very important recommendation

Double-check all your data multiple times. There have been cases where gestors entered incorrect NIE in invoices or
there were erroneous data in contracts.

This is rare, but it can happen in a large sample, so I highly recommend double-checking everything carefully. By doing
so, you will reduce the risk of problems and fines in the future.
