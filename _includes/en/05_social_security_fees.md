### Social contributions (Seguridad Social)

They need to be paid regardless of whether there is income for the autónomo. So, if you lose clients, you will continue
to pay while looking for new ones.

The first year has a discount (you need to pay €86.66 per month). If you registered as an autónomo after the 1-st day
of the month, the first payment for social contributions will be less (for example, if you registered in the middle
of the month, then for the first month you will pay approximately €86.66/2 = €43.33).
