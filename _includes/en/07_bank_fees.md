### Fee for transfer to a bank account

If you receive money via an international SWIFT transfer (for example, I receive transfers from the USA to an account in
a Spanish bank), there may be a fee for such a transfer. It is approximately 20-30 euros.

This fee can also be deducted from taxes (amounting to several hundred euros a year). It is enough to upload a bank
statement about the crediting of funds to the account to the Xolo dashboard; the Xolo gestors will calculate the
difference themselves (the amount in your invoice minus the amount credited to the bank account equals the fee) and
deduct this fee from taxes.
