### Property in other countries

When you file your tax return for the first year, you must declare any property acquired in other countries (e.g. real
estate).

In case of selling real estate in another country, you will need to pay tax in Spain. However, if you sell your main
residence and reinvest those funds in a home in Spain, you can avoid paying taxes on the sale.
