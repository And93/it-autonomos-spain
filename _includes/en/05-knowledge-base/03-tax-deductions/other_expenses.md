### Other professional expenses

You can deduct other expenses related to professional activities from your taxes.

For example:

- Subscription to the IDE you use (e.g. IntelliJ)
- Subscription to ChatGPT (if used for work)
- Training courses, etc.

It is important that all these expenses are necessary for your professional activity.

You need to upload the invoices for these expenses to the Xolo dashboard. The invoices must include your name and NIE.
