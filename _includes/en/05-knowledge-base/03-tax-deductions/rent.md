### Rent

You can send your rental agreement to your gestor or Xolo. They will analyze it (Xolo does this for free, but with
gestors, it may vary) and tell you if you can deduct part of your rent expenses from taxes. If your agreement prohibits
this (as mine did), there is an option to sign an additional agreement with the landlord. Check with your landlord if
they are okay with signing it. If they agree, ask your gestor or Xolo to prepare an addendum to the contract (Xolo
charges 36 euros for this). In my case, the landlord did not object, and I signed this addendum, which explicitly states
that I am allowed to conduct economic activities in the rented property.

I strongly recommend not coming up with reasons why the landlord might refuse. Just ask them, thatâ€™s all. I've heard
various assumptions from some people about why it might be unprofitable for the landlord (and these people never find
out, deciding for the landlord themselves).

How much can you deduct? Xolo uses the following formula:

_[rental cost in euros] * 30% * [% of apartment area used for economic activities]_

Algorithm:

1. Analyze your contract and find the clause prohibiting commercial activities (if it exists). You can use ChatGPT for
   this or send your contract to your gestor or Xolo for analysis.
2. If your contract prohibits commercial activities in the rented property, you need to sign an addendum to allow this
   activity.
3. Ask your gestor or Xolo to prepare an addendum to the contract, allowing commercial activities.
4. Sign this PDF document (I used the signature feature on my MacBook).
5. Send it to your landlord for their signature as well.
6. Send the signed addendum to your gestor or Xolo so they can record it and approve the rent expense deduction in the
   future.
7. Every month, provide a bank statement of the rent payment to your gestor or upload it to the Xolo dashboard (an
   invoice is not required, only the statement).
