### Food, lunches

You can deduct Food & Drinks and business lunches with clients. A business lunch must be a meeting with a client. There
should also be proof (e.g., an email with the client confirming that you agreed to meet at a restaurant to discuss work
matters).

Regarding Food & Drinks, it refers to bars, restaurants, and hotels (food purchased in a supermarket does not qualify).
However, you will need to justify to the tax authorities that these were necessary expenses and were incurred during
working hours.

I do not deduct any of this because I do not see a way to adequately justify it to the tax authorities. If you have
experience with such deductions, please share.

To deduct this from taxes, you need to provide your gestor or Xolo with a full invoice (with your NIE, full name, and
aut√≥nomo registration address).
