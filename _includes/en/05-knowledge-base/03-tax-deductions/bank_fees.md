### Fee for transfer to a bank account

If you receive money via an international SWIFT transfer (for example, I receive transfers from the USA to an account in
a Spanish bank), there may be a fee for such a transfer. It is approximately 20-30 euros.

This fee can also be deducted from taxes (it amounts to several hundred euros per year). It is sufficient to
upload to the Xolo dashboard a bank statement indicating the transfer fee.
