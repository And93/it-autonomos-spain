### Subscription payment

_Important: I recommend reading this before making a payment to be fully informed._

After completing all the forms for registering as an aut贸nomo, and after you pay for the Xolo subscription, the process
of registering as an aut贸nomo (sending your data to the relevant government bodies) will be initiated. So, if you need
to register as an aut贸nomo quickly, you can pay for the subscription right away.

But there is one issue. If you register with Xolo at the end of the month (for example, on August 29), and immediately
pay for the subscription, your first payment will be charged on August 29 (for August). But on September 1, a second
payment will be charged, this time for September. Both payments will be 100% of the monthly subscription cost. This is a
subtle point that several people in the chat have already encountered. It is mentioned in the FAQ on their website, but
not everyone will look for this information there, so I decided to add it here.

In the end, if you need to register as an aut贸nomo as soon as possible, just pay for the subscription without
hesitation. But if you start the registration process closer to the end of the month and can wait a few days, keep in
mind that you can save a little by shifting the subscription payment to the next month.
