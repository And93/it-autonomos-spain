### Risk of losing the Seguridad Social discount

Always keep enough money in the account from which payments for Seguridad Social are deducted. If there is not enough
money when trying to make a withdrawal, you may lose the discount for the month when the payment for Seguridad Social
could not be deducted the first time. Also, there is a risk of a fine.

The discount for Seguridad Social is valid for 12 months after registering as an autónomo. If you close your autónomo
within 12 months, you will not be able to activate the discount again within 3 years after closing your autónomo.

I also heard that many people have problems with deductions in the first month. This can be checked in advance. You need
to check that the correct IBAN account is specified in the Seguridad Social office, from which payments for Seguridad
Social will be deducted.
