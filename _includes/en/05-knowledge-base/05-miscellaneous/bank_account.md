### Which bank account and which bank to use

You must have an account in a Spanish bank because taxes and social payments will be debited from there.

It is recommended to use
banks [approved by the Spanish tax authorities](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/deudas-apremios-embargos-subastas/pagar-aplazar-consultar/listado-entidades-bancarias-adheridas.html?faqId=c2018148e27c2710VgnVCM100000dc381e0aRCRD){:

#### If you receive payments in USD

In this case, besides an account in a Spanish bank, it would be more beneficial to additionally
open an account in Wise or Revolut. You can receive USD on this
account, then convert USD to EUR and transfer to an account in a Spanish bank.
Many in the chat recommend this option, as
receiving USD on an account in a Spanish bank is less advantageous (due to fees and/or
conversion rates).

**Revolut:** It is recommended to purchase a Revolut Premium subscription, as it will be
more profitable considering the reduced currency conversion fees.

**Wise:** The advantage of Wise is that the balance earns about 4% per annum.

Which of these options will be more beneficial for you, calculate personally
based on your salary, the amount you want to keep in
dollars/euros, where and why you will transfer money, etc.

#### If you receive payments in EUR

This option is simpler and more convenient. It is comfortable to receive money directly to an account in
a Spanish bank. In this case, Wise/Revolut is not needed.
It is enough to have only an account in a Spanish bank.

#### Taxation and account usage

In Spain, you need to pay taxes only for those credits to the account for which you
provide an invoice for the tax agency.

Also, for the tax agency, there are no problems if you receive payments not to
an account in a Spanish bank, but for example, to Wise or Revolut.

You can use your personal account or a joint account with your spouse in a Spanish bank to receive payments
as an autónomo. The convenience of a joint account is that you can both spend
money from it.

The account to which you receive payments as an autónomo (in a Spanish bank) can also
be used for personal expenses. Also, there are no problems
if your friend transfers you 100 euros for a dinner at a restaurant to this same account
(no taxes need to be paid on this receipt). I additionally
clarified this with Xolo support. You will need to pay taxes only on autónomo receipts.

If desired, you can use different accounts for autónomo and for personal needs.

You do not need to open any special account for autónomo. You need to
open a regular personal account in a Spanish bank and when opening it,
say that you do not conduct any economic activity in
Spain, and you do not have any work here at all. And already after
you open this account and register autónomo, you will need to
bring the relevant documents to the bank, and they will make the necessary changes on their side
(more details about this in other steps of the autónomo registration).

#### Bank recommendations

Many use Spanish banks Santander or BBVA, but you can use other banks as well. Personally, I use Santander.
