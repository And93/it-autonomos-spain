## Regular downloading of all documents

I highly recommend making a backup of all your documents (declarations, invoices, etc.) related to your autÃ³nomo. I have
set myself a reminder and do this every 3 months. Yes, some of these documents (declarations) are stored in the tax
office, and you can access them at any time. However, your invoices, for example, are not stored at the tax office. By
regularly making backups, you will protect yourself from unpleasant situations.

In the Xolo dashboard, all documents can be saved here: Reports -> Data export.

If you have an individual gestor, arrange with them to periodically send you a full archive of your documents.
