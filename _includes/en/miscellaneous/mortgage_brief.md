## Obtaining a mortgage in Spain for autónomo: My experience and mistakes

One of the reasons I registered as an autónomo was the opportunity to get a mortgage.

Recently, my spouse and I obtained a mortgage in Valencia for 80% of the property value (2.95% annual interest rate).
This was despite me being an autónomo for less than 8 months and without an annual tax declaration (renta). The entire
process took less than a month and a half, from our initial visit to the bank and the question, "Is it possible to get a
mortgage and what is needed?" to receiving the keys to the apartment. We also live in Spain under temporary protection
for Ukrainians.

Briefly about the apartment: 120 square meters, 5 rooms (only one with a window facing an inner courtyard), a large
living room, 2 bathrooms, a separate kitchen with a gallery, a balcony, and a building with an elevator. The apartment
has partial renovations. The building itself is very well-maintained, with a complete renovation of the entrance,
facade, and roof done a few years ago. The metro is a 2-minute walk away, and Valencia city center is 5 minutes by
metro. I won't disclose the price of the apartment.

The process could have taken less time if we hadn’t fought until the end for a 90% mortgage (which we had a good chance
of obtaining).

The amount required to obtain the mortgage: 20% down payment of the property's cost, 9% ITP tax (property transfer tax),
€4000 agency fee, around €1000 for notary services, plus up to €1000 for various small expenses (some of which will be
refunded later).

Overall, I wouldn’t say the entire process was very difficult, but rather moderately so. There were many places where
both my spouse and I needed to be present with our young son, which sometimes made things challenging (viewing
apartments, some bank visits, notary, etc.). Additionally, since I don’t speak Spanish, I had to rely on Google
Translate and ChatGPT, which complicated the process significantly.

**I have described the entire mortgage process [in a separate article](./en/mortgage/), and I hope my experience will
be helpful to you.**
