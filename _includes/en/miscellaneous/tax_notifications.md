## Notifications from the tax office

From my experience, I would recommend periodically checking notifications from the tax office. You can do this
here: [Tax Agency: My personal area](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/en_gb/mi-area-personal.html){:target="_
blank"}

This is not mandatory; if something urgent comes up, you will likely be informed by the tax office through other
channels (SMS, regular mail, or other ways). But I decided to add this link to the document because it was useful to me
once.
