## Obtaining a plastic SIP for family members

> With the SIP card, patients can receive medical services in public hospitals and clinics. The procedure for obtaining
> a card may vary depending on which comunidad autónoma of Spain you live in. Somewhere initially they issue a plastic
> permanent SIP when you first go to apply for it, and somewhere they issue a paper SIP with a limited validity period.
> If your family members do not have a permanent plastic SIP, it can be obtained after the autónomo registration.

**Method #1**

The most reliable way. After registering as an autónomo (better to wait a few days), visit your local Centro de Salud
and inform them that you would like to get a plastic SIP for your family members. They will tell you what documents are
required for this.

**Method #2**

1. Go to the [Tu Seguridad Social](https://sede-tu.seg-social.gob.es/){:target="_blank"} portal.
2. Navigate to the section Representante -> Tu Asistencia Sanitaria: Gestiona tus beneficiarios and enter your
   personal account.
3. Add your family members (you will need to upload scanned documents).
4. Wait a few days, then go to the Centro de Salud with the documents to receive the plastic SIP.

**Method #3**

I followed this instruction. It may not be the fastest, but it works as well.

1. First, I made an appointment (cita) at the Seguridad Social.
2. A few days later, I went there with my spouse and child.
3. In 15 minutes, my spouse and child were registered with an NSS (Número de Seguridad Social).
4. A few days later, my spouse received an SMS saying that they could go to the Centro de Salud and pick up the plastic
   SIP.
5. A couple of days later, my spouse went to the Centro de Salud and picked up the plastic SIP for herself and the
   child.

How to get a cita:

1. Go to the website of the Spanish Social Security
   service: [Seguridad Social Sede Electrónica](https://sede.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/sede/sede/Inicio){:target="_
   blank"}.
2. Click on the link “Cita previa para prestaciones y otras gestiones - Ciudadanos” (Appointment for social benefits and
   other services - Citizens).
3. On the next page, select “Obtener cita previa para pensiones y otras prestaciones (INSS). Sin certificado” (Get an
   appointment for pensions and other benefits (INSS). Without a certificate). Click "Obtener".
4. Fill in your personal details
    - Enter your NIE number.
    - Enter your first and last name.
    - Enter your phone number.
    - Motivo de la cita - enter "ACREDITAR COBERTURA SANITARIA PARA MI ESPOSA E HIJO CON NIE" (MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR MY
      WIFE AND SON WITH NIE - edit this according to your purpose).
    - "Búsqueda de citas por código postal, provincia y centro" - select "Primera cita disponible en el centro más
      próximo a este código postal". Then enter your postal code.
5. Choose the type of appointment "Solicitud de otras prestaciones" (Request for other benefits).
6. If there are available appointments, you will be able to proceed without any issues. If not, try checking for
   appointments later; we were able to get one within a few days.
7. When you go to the social service, remember the golden rule - take as many documents with you as possible. Even if I
   provide a precise list of the documents we were asked to present, it doesn’t mean you won’t be asked for something
   additional.
8. Register the NSS (Número de la Seguridad Social) for your relatives at the social service, wait a few days, and then
   go to the Centro de Salud to get the plastic SIP (contact the reception).
