## Providing a digital certificate to the gestor

**You must never share your personal digital certificate with anyone, as it carries significant risks.**

Some gestors may ask you to provide them with your personal digital certificate so that they can file reports and
perform other operations on your behalf. **This approach is dangerous and absolutely unacceptable.**

By sharing your digital certificate with third parties:

1. The holder of your certificate can perform various operations related to your autónomo (change data, file reports,
   sign any documents) on your behalf. However, you will bear the responsibility for these actions.
2. The gestor will not be liable for any errors in reporting or other operations because all these operations will be
   carried out directly on your behalf (using your personal digital certificate).
3. You can imagine many unpleasant situations that could arise. Even if you have a trustworthy gestor, it doesn't
   protect you from the risk of their computer being hacked, resulting in the theft of your digital certificate.

**What should you do? The best option.**

You need to authorize your gestor's digital certificate using your personal digital certificate (this can be done
through the tax office, and the gestor will guide you on how to do it). After that, the gestor will be able to file
reports and perform necessary operations for managing your autónomo using their own certificate (gestor's). It will
always be recorded that the gestor acted on their behalf, but with your permission. In case of any issues or errors, it
will be clearly documented that the gestor's actions led to them.

If, for some operations, your gestor insists on having your personal certificate, remember that you always have the
option to make a call and handle everything interactively on your computer (for example, using TeamViewer). This way,
you won't need to hand over the certificate.
