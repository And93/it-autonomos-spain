## Annual declaration

The Renta (annual declaration - Modelo 100) is submitted once a year. The submission process is the same for both
gestores and Xolo. In most cases, this is a separate paid service.

You will receive a large questionnaire in which you will need to provide information about your family, children, and
spouse, as well as answer questions that affect the calculations. This questionnaire needs to be carefully filled out.
You will be consulted on all the nuances (e.g., what tax deductions can be applied) and helped to fill out the
questionnaire. After that, a draft version will be sent to you for review (it will contain all the calculations and the
final tax amount). After your review and confirmation, the declaration will be sent to the tax authorities, and you will
be informed about the tax payment date.

Later, the tax authorities will deduct the funds from the specified account (in case of underpayment of taxes), or,
conversely, will return any overpaid amounts (within 6 months). Make sure that the required amount is in the account,
otherwise, serious problems may arise.

_Do not worry that there is currently no detailed information in the document about filling out Modelo 100. I will begin
working on this in advance, so by the time you need to submit this declaration, a detailed guide will be available
here._
