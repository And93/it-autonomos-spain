## Invoice date

In Spain, accounting and tax reports are based on the invoice issue date, not the date when funds are credited to the
bank account.

If an invoice is issued in the current quarter but the payment is received in the next one, this is acceptable. However,
if the funds were received in the previous quarter but the invoice is issued in the current one, this is a violation.

When issuing invoices for services provided over a calendar month, it is recommended to date the invoice the last day of
that month (e.g., the invoice date for services provided in January would be January 31).

It is ideal to create and send invoices to the client and gestor on the last day of the month. If this is not possible,
it is important to issue an invoice for the previous month as early as possible in the new month. For example, an
invoice for January I usually create by February 3.

If there is an error in the invoice (e.g., an incorrect amount), contact your gestor immediately to report this.

Until the 20th day of the first month of the new quarter, it is theoretically possible to include new invoices in the
previous quarter if the accounting is done correctly. This is relevant for those on a quarterly tax reporting system. In
this system, invoices are not sent directly to the tax office â€” they are used by the accountant for filing declarations.
However, the monthly system has its specifics: invoices for the past month must be sent to the tax office within the set
deadlines.
