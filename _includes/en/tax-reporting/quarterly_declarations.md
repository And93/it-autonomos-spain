## Quarterly declarations

As a rule, an aut贸nomo is required to submit several declarations each quarter, depending on the type of activity,
business structure, and other obligations. Below is a list of some of the most likely declarations you may need.

**Modelo 130:** A declaration where the income for the quarter is indicated, minus expenses for the calculation and
payment of IRPF. Submitted by aut贸nomos who do not use the direct IRPF withholding scheme based on invoices.

**Modelo 303:** IVA declaration. All aut贸nomos and companies are required to submit it, except for those whose
activities are exempt from IVA (for example, doctors or landlords of tourist property). It indicates the amount of IVA
collected from clients, the amount of IVA paid on business purchases, and the final calculation - how much needs to be
paid or refunded.

**Modelo 349:** This declaration is submitted monthly, quarterly, or annually if you provide services or supply goods to
clients in other EU countries without charging IVA.

**Modelo 111:** Submitted by every aut贸nomo who has employees or contractors from whom IRPF is withheld. This
declaration applies to all those from whom IRPF is withheld, including freelancers and contractors who invoice you with
IRPF withholding.

**Modelo 115:** This declaration is required if you rent commercial premises and are obligated to withhold 19%
retenciones on rental payments.

Quarterly declarations are submitted during the first 20 days of April, July, October, and January for the previous
quarter.
