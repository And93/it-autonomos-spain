## Invoice currency

You can issue invoices to your clients in any currency (e.g., dollars, pounds, or euros). However, all accounting in
Spain will be maintained in euros. If your invoices are, for example, in dollars, the gestor will convert the dollar to
euros at the current exchange rate.

Suppose you issue an invoice to a client for $1,000, and the client sends $1,000 to your bank account. The gestor will
submit the invoice to the tax office in euros (based on the USD-EUR exchange rate valid on the invoice date). Funds may
arrive in your account a few days after the invoice is issued, during which time the USD-EUR rate may have changed. As a
result, you may receive slightly more or slightly less in euros. In this case, you will need to inform the gestor, who
will register the difference as an expense or additional income, depending on the situation.

Additionally, due to the added complexity of invoices in other currencies (not in euros), if you have many such invoices
per month, the gestor's services may cost more.
