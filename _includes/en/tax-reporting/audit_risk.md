## Risk of tax audits if deducting rent from taxes

I heard that some gestors do not recommend deducting housing rent from taxes and claim that it increases the risk of tax
audits.

I became curious about how reliable this statement is and where this information comes from. I asked Xolo support and
some gestors I know. None of the sources could provide statistics confirming that rent deductions truly increase the
risk of tax audits.

To simplify the verification process by the tax authorities, the standard sets that the maximum area used for economic
activity cannot exceed 30% of the total apartment area. It is not necessary to keep documents to justify the used space,
but it is required to keep bills for electricity, water, and internet, which will be accounted for proportionally to the
declared area. Hacienda may conduct inspections but cannot inspect the home without a warrant.

**My conclusions:**

1. I don’t understand why some are so afraid of tax audits. It’s enough not to hide your income, apply tax deductions
   correctly, keep records carefully, and avoid using gray schemes. In that case, audits are not scary.
2. I suspect that some professionals forget an important truth: "after" does not mean "because of." They likely create a
   narrative around the deduction of housing rent from taxes and the associated tax audits.
3. Remember that it is always important to pay attention to the sample size on which conclusions are based. Even if one
   gestor had several clients who deducted housing rent and faced tax audits, this does not indicate a pattern. It does
   not guarantee that such a situation will occur with all or most gestors. For reliable conclusions, a representative
   and sufficiently large sample is required.
