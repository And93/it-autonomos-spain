### How to create an invoice in Xolo?

My employer prepares invoices on their side every month. I use these invoices as a basis and manually create invoices in
Xolo.

I create invoices in the first days of the current month for the previous month. For example, I create the invoice for
January on February 3-5.

How to create an invoice:

1. Go to the Income tab -> click New Sales Invoice.
2. Set the invoice date to the date on my employer's invoice (e.g. January 31).
3. The due date can be set to 10 days after the invoice date.
4. For the description field, I also take it from my employer's invoice. For example, "Software development services in
   1-Feb-24 - 29-Feb-24".
5. Quantity can be left as is, 1 pc.
6. Price - the amount specified in the employer's invoice.
7. Comments, interest, discount - I do not fill in.
8. Send the completed invoice.

Also, once there was a need to correct the amount in an already sent invoice. I contacted Xolo support, and they
promptly updated everything.
