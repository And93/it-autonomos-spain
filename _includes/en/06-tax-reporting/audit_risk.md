## Risk of tax audits if deducting rent from taxes

I have heard several times the assertion that gestors do not recommend deducting rent from taxes, and that this
increases the risk of tax audits.

I became curious about how much to trust these gestors and where they got this information (I do not rule out that they
are right). Therefore, I decided to check with Xolo, who have significantly more clients than any individual gestor.
Below is Xolo's response.

**My conclusions:**

1. I do not understand why some people are so afraid of tax audits. I can say personally that I do not hide taxes and do
   not deduct from taxes what cannot be deducted. I do not use any grey schemes like family aut√≥nomo (in my case, it
   would be a grey scheme). If there is a tax audit, I see no reason why I should be afraid of it.
2. I suspect that some gestors may forget the simple truth that "after" does not mean "because of". And they probably
   build a narrative regarding rent deductions and the presence of tax audits.

**Xolo's response (shortened):**

To simplify verification by tax authorities, it is standard that the maximum area used for economic activity cannot
exceed 30% of the total apartment area. It is not required to keep documents to justify the used meters, but it is
necessary to keep bills for electricity, water, and internet, which will be taken into account proportionally to the
declared area. Hacienda can conduct audits but cannot inspect the home without a warrant. We have no statistics that
deducting rent increases the risk of tax audits.
