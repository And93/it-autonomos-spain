# Gestor to Xolo transition

If you decide to transition from your gestor to Xolo, the process is very simple and quick.

1. Register using the **[referral link](https://bit.ly/xolosignup){:target="_blank"}** (50 € bonus to your account for
   registration):
    - Click the Sign Up button at the top right.
    - Choose the Global plan (59 euros + VAT) - this plan is necessary if your clients are outside Spain.
    - Check that the registration page has the section "We detected a referral code:" with the filled value.
    - Enter your first name, last name, email, phone number, click Sign Up - then a login link to the Xolo dashboard
      will be sent to your email.
    - Do you reside in Spain? (living here for more than 183 days in a year) or plan to be? - YES
    - Are you registered as an autónomo in Spain - YES
    - Do you plan to immediately have dependent employees (on payroll)? - NO
    - Do you have dependent employees (on payroll)? - NO
    - What is your expected annual income? - Any value, income may change over time (and this is normal for an
      autónomo).
2. Log in using the link in the email, and click the "I'm already autónomo" button.
3. Fill out a small form:
    - email
    - phone number
    - autónomo registration date
    - I have employees - NO (note that Xolo does not support [colaborador](#autónomo-colaborador))
    - I'm using 7% IRPF on invoice - if you're not sure what this is, you probably don't use it (better to clarify with
      your gestor)
    - Tax register declaration - form 036 or 037
    - Social Security resolution (if you don't have it, check the box I haven't registered to Social Security)
4. Wait 1-2 business days while your data is verified.
5. If all documents are correct, your application will be accepted, and you will need to complete ID verification (this
   is quick, you will need to photograph your document and take a selfie).
6. Pay for the subscription, after that you can start using Xolo.
7. After paying for the subscription, you will be asked to provide additional documents. You can send them to Xolo via
   email, or you can provide Xolo with your previous gestor's contact information, and they will contact them to request
   all necessary documents:
    - Your previous gestor will need to sign a document that allows Xolo to process the data transfer in accordance with
      GDPR.
    - Declarations for the previous quarters of the current year.
    - All declarations from the last 4 years (or since you registered as autónomo).
    - Accounting books.
    - Photo of your ID/Residence Permit (both sides).
    - [Certificate of tax status](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/en_gb/procedimientoini/G313.shtml){:

_After completing all these steps, the transition from your gestor to Xolo will be complete._
