### Risk of losing the Seguridad Social discount

Always keep enough money in the account from which payments for Seguridad Social are deducted. If there are insufficient
funds when attempting to withdraw, you may lose the discount (which is given for the first 12 months) and will have to
pay the full amount. Additionally, a fine may be imposed.

I've also heard that many people have problems with payment deductions in the first month. This can also be checked in
advance. Make sure the correct IBAN of the account from which Seguridad Social payments will be deducted is specified on
the Seguridad Social portal.
