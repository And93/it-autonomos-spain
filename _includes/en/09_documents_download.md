### Regular downloading of all documents

On the Xolo dashboard, there is an option to download all documents (declarations, etc.)
related to your aut√≥nomo. I would recommend doing this
regularly, setting a reminder for yourself (I do it every 3 months).

It's unknown how or why this might come in handy (it might not be useful at all), but it will be safer this way.

If you have an individual gestor, I would recommend discussing this procedure with them.
