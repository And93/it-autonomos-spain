### Tax audits

The statute of limitations for tax audits is 4 years.

There is a popular belief that the more you deduct from taxes, the higher the theoretical likelihood of a tax audit for
you. However, according to information from gestors, there is no such correlation. There are many aut√≥nomos who deduct
almost nothing, but the tax authorities audit them, and there are those who deduct a lot, but have not been audited.
