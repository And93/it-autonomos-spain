### Rent

You can send your rental agreement to Xolo, and they will analyze it (for free) and tell you if you can deduct part of
the rent from your taxes. If your agreement prohibits this (as mine did), you can sign an addendum with
your landlord. Ask your landlord if they are okay with signing it - if they agree, ask Xolo to prepare the addendum (36
euros). In my case, the landlord was fine with it, so I signed the addendum to be able to deduct part of the rent from
taxes.

I strongly recommend not coming up with reasons why the landlord might object. Just ask, and that's it. I've heard
various speculations from some people about why the landlord might find it disadvantageous (and these people often don't
even ask, deciding for the landlord).

How much can you deduct? Xolo's formula is:

_[rent cost in euros] * 30% * [% of the apartment area used for economic activity]_

Algorithm:

- Analyze your contract and find a clause prohibiting commercial activity (if there is one). You can use ChatGPT for
  this or send your contract to Xolo to have them analyze it (for free).
- If your contract prohibits commercial activity in rented housing, you need to sign an addendum to the contract to
  allow this activity.
- Ask to prepare an addendum to the contract that allows commercial activity.
- Sign this PDF document (I used the signature on my MacBook).
- Send it to your landlord for their signature as well.
- Send the signed addendum to Xolo support, so they can record it and approve the deduction of rent expenses in the
  future.
- Each month, upload a bank statement showing the deduction for rent to the Xolo dashboard (an invoice is not needed,
  just the statement).
