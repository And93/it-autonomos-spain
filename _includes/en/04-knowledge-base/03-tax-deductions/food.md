### Food, lunches

You can deduct Food & Drinks and business lunches with clients. A business lunch should be a business meeting with a
client. There should also be proof (for example, an email with the client indicating that you agreed to meet at a
restaurant and discuss business matters).

Regarding Food & Drinks, it refers to bars, restaurants, hotels (food purchased at a supermarket will not qualify).
However, you will need to justify to the tax authorities that these were necessary expenses made during working hours.

I do not deduct any of this because I do not see a way to adequately justify it to the tax authorities. If you have
experience with such deductions, please share.
