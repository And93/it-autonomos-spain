### Electricity

You need to upload the invoice for electricity to the Xolo dashboard. The invoice must include your name, NIE, and the
address of the aut√≥nomo registration.

If the electricity contract is not signed by you, you will not be able to deduct these expenses. From my experience, the
procedure for transferring the contract is quite simple (write to support, and they will help you with this).
