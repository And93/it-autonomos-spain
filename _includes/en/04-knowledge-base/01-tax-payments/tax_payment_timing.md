### Paying taxes for the entire year or from the date of aut贸nomo registration

When you register as an aut贸nomo, there is a chance that you will become a tax resident for the current year starting
January 1st (even if you registered as an aut贸nomo in the middle of the year). It is difficult to say in advance whether
the tax authorities will consider you a tax resident or not, as it depends on many factors and is generally a rather
complex topic (you can read

A tax resident must pay taxes on income for the entire year (even on income received in other countries).

Some people take a risk in this situation and do not declare their income before registering as an aut贸nomo (there is a
risk that they will be audited later). Others honestly declare everything and pay taxes on previously earned income. It
is better to choose the option with the least amount of risk.

If you decide to hide your income from other countries from the beginning of the year, there is always a risk that the
tax authorities will find out about it, and you will be held accountable.
