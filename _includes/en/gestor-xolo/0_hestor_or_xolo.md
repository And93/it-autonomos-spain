# Gestor or Xolo?

I registered and manage autonomo through the [Xolo](https://bit.ly/xolosignup){:target="_blank"} service
instead of an individual gestor. The platform completely replaces a gestor and is ideal for freelancers from IT,
marketing, media, design, consulting, and [other fields](#is-xolo-suitable-for-you).

- Subscription costs 59 €/month + IVA (gestors up to 91 €/month + IVA).
- Autonomo registration - free (gestors up to 120 € + IVA).
- EU VAT registration - free (gestors up to 120 € + IVA).
- A large team of gestors with experience serving 100,000 autonomos.
- Support in English and Spanish, responding quickly.
- All communication with the tax authorities is handled by the
  service ([proven by personal experience](#my-problem-with-the-spanish-tax-office)).
- No need to provide your personal digital certificate. The service submits reports using their own digital
  certificates.
- The service [takes responsibility for errors](#xolos-liability) in reporting.
- [Convenient dashboard](#dashboard-demo-tutorials) for income/tax statistics, tax deductions, invoices, and
  notifications.
- Partnership agreement with Agencia Tributaria (Spanish Tax Agency).
- Xolo does not support [autónomo colaborador](#autónomo-colaborador).
- [Xolo limitations](#is-xolo-suitable-for-you).

Register using the **[referral link](https://bit.ly/xolosignup){:target="_blank"}** (50 € bonus to your
account for registration).
