### Invoice language

In Xolo, you can choose the language for generating invoices (Spanish or English). Personally, I do them in English, but
some aut√≥nomos in the chat recommend doing them in Spanish. I asked Xolo, and they said that the tax authorities accept
invoices equally in both languages; it doesn't matter if they are in English or Spanish.
