### Medical insurance

You can deduct expenses for medical insurance (500 euros per year for yourself and the same amount for family members
under 25 years old).

You need to upload the invoice for medical insurance to the Xolo dashboard. The invoice must include your name and NIE.

Personally, I do not deduct it because I only use the public healthcare system in Spain (which is one of the best in the
world).
