### Providing an electronic certificate to the gestor

Almost all gestors ask you to give them your personal electronic certificate. They will then submit reports on your
behalf. To me, this seems, to put it mildly, strange when a gestor takes money for managing the aut√≥nomo and at the same
time bears absolutely no responsibility.

So, when looking for a gestor, try to find one who will not require your personal key (surely there are such, but they
are hard to find). I have heard that good gestors may have insurance for situations where they made a mistake.

Xolo uses their own certificates for reporting and [takes responsibility](#responsibility-in-case-of-error) if errors
were made. For me, this is a huge advantage.
