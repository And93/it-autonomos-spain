### Fee for incoming funds to a bank account

A fee of 20-30 EUR is charged for incoming funds through an international SWIFT payment (for example, from the
USA). This happens because the payment fee must be paid by either the sender or the receiver, and in some cases,
it falls on the receiver. It cannot be avoided. However, this fee can
be [deducted from taxes](#fee-for-transfer-to-a-bank-account).
