## Lifehacks with invoices

A couple of lifehacks that might come in handy if you need to deduct something from taxes, but the service provider
does not provide the option to download a full invoice with your NIE and all the necessary details.

**Lifehack #1**

Write to the support of the service whose costs you want to deduct from taxes and ask them to generate an invoice
with all the required information (your name, address, NIE). Often this method works, and they generate a custom
invoice with all the necessary information.

**Lifehack #2**

Enter your NIE in the "address line 2" field. One popular service, for which I needed to deduct expenses from taxes,
even recommends this method in their FAQ.

I have used both methods. However, I am not sure if the second lifehack is completely legal (if you know for sure,
please let me know - I will update the information here).
