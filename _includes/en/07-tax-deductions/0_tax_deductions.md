# Tax deductions and benefits

The tax deduction mechanism in Spain allows an autónomo to reduce their taxable base by including certain expenses
related to professional activity (e.g., office rent, purchase of equipment, service subscriptions).

To deduct expenses, it is necessary to provide full invoices (indicating your NIE, name, and autónomo
registration address) to your gestor or upload them to the Xolo dashboard. In rare cases, bank statements may be
acceptable instead of full invoices (this is specified separately below).

Some believe it is not worth bothering with tax deductions, thinking the amounts are small. From my experience, aside
from direct savings, there may be other positive side effects. For example, after I transferred the electricity contract
to my name, I also decided to switch to a more favorable tariff (this became easier to do because the contract was now
under my name). As a result, monthly expenses decreased from 180-200 euros to 100-120 euros per month (almost half). Add
the tax deductions to this.

Below is a list of expenses that I deduct from taxes or know about. Feel free to share your experiences in the chat if
you have something to add.
