## Secret section

Thank you for reading this document to the end. I am glad that it was useful for you. I put a lot of effort into its
creation and constantly update the information to keep it relevant and helpful.

Let me briefly tell you how this document came about.

For the past few years, I have had a habit of recording all the complex bureaucratic processes I encounter in my
personal knowledge base. This helps me save time when I face the same problem again in the future. One of these complex
things for me was everything related to the autónomo. Before I registered it, I learned a lot of information in advance
from my acquaintances. Later, I thought that my notes could be useful to others as well. That is how this document
became publicly available.

And briefly about myself :) I am a Java Developer and Java Team Lead.

If you would like to thank me for this work, here are a few ways to do so:
