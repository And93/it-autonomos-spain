### Waste tax

If you decide to deduct rent, water supply, and electricity from taxes, you will likely need to pay the waste tax.

The waste tax is a municipal tax charged for waste collection and disposal. It may be proportional to the area
used for professional activity.

How much exactly needs to be paid, I cannot say right now. But I know that it is a small amount (possibly a few tens of
euros per year). I will write more precisely when I pay the tax.
