### Property in other countries

When you file your declaration for the first year, you can declare property acquired in other countries (for example,
real estate).

If you have real estate, it is better to declare it right away. This way, you won't have to pay taxes when you sell it.
My knowledge on this matter is too superficial; I do not know exactly how this is done and what the nuances are.
