# Reliable gestors

In the [autonomo chat](https://bit.ly/it-autonomos-spain-eng){:target="_blank"}, there are frequent requests to
recommend a good gestor. Finding such specialists can be difficult.

Before starting a collaboration, read about the [criteria for a reliable gestor](#criteria-for-a-reliable-gestor) and
the entire [gestors section](#gestor-1).

The list of recommended gestors will always remain small. Gestors on the list must meet reliability criteria. If you
have someone to recommend, please share their contact information.

The specialists listed below are trusted professionals whom I have repeatedly consulted on work-related issues. Click
the "Contact the gestor" button and fill out the form â€” the gestor will respond to you within the working day (in rare
cases, the next day). If the issue is urgent, please indicate this in your message to expedite the response.
