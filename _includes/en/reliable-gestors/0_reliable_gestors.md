# Reliable gestors

In the [autonomo chat](https://bit.ly/it-autonomos-spain-eng){:target="_blank"}, there are frequent requests to
recommend a good gestor. Finding such specialists can be difficult.

Before starting cooperation, be sure to read about the [criteria for a reliable gestor](#criteria-for-a-reliable-gestor)
and preferably the entire [gestors section](#gestor-1).

The list of recommended gestors will always remain small. Gestors on the list must meet reliability criteria. If you
have someone to recommend, please share their contact information.

The specialists listed below are trusted professionals whom I have repeatedly consulted on work-related issues. Click
the "Contact the gestor" button and fill out the form - the gestor will respond to you within the working day (in rare
cases, the next day). If the issue is urgent, please indicate this in your message to expedite the response.

If you suddenly have any disputes with gestors or need any assistance, write to me in private messages, and I will do my
best to help (you can find my contacts in the chat). It is important to me to be sure that all the gestors on the list
provide you with quality service and that any disputes are successfully resolved.
