# Reliable gestors

In our autónomo chat, there are occasional requests to recommend a good and reliable gestor. Such gestors can be
difficult to find, as they often no longer have available slots and do not accept new clients.

Some autónomos specifically need an individual gestor (Xolo may not suit them for various reasons). I decided to start
keeping a list of trusted gestors recommended by autónomos from our chat. Before starting cooperation with any gestor, I
recommend reading about the [criteria for a reliable gestor](#criteria-for-a-reliable-gestor) and the
entire [gestors section](#gestor-1).

This list will remain small, and I will add new gestors as I discover them. If you can confidently recommend your
gestor, if you've been working with them for a while, and you appreciate their qualification and responsibility, please
share their contact.
