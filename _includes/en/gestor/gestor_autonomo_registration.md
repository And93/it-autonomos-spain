## Registration of Autónomo (gestor)

The procedure for registering an autónomo with a [gestor](#reliable-gestors) is as simple as possible because the gestor will do everything
for you.

1. You will need to provide the gestor with scans
   of [documents for autónomo registration](#necessary-documents-for-registering-an-autónomo).
2. The gestor will ask you for all the necessary information and advise you on the types of economic activities
   (epígrafes IAE) under which the autónomo will be registered. They will also point out other nuances that may arise
   during the registration process.
3. The gestor will register the autónomo for you (this is done very quickly, and then you will need to wait a little).

Some gestors can register the autónomo for you without your personal digital certificate. They can do this if they are
registered in special registries that allow them to register autónomos for their clients with only scanned documents.
You can find such a gestor in the section [reliable gestors](#reliable-gestors).

If your gestor is not registered in the appropriate registries, they will need your digital certificate to register the
autónomo. Carefully read the section
about [providing a digital certificate to the gestor](#providing-a-digital-certificate-to-the-gestor) before
proceeding further.
