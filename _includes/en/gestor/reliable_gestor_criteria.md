## Criteria for a reliable gestor

When searching for a gestor, always ask if they meet all the criteria described below. If they do not meet any of the
criteria, I recommend looking for another specialist.

- Adequate communication and prompt response to requests. It sounds basic, but if your communication is slow and
  problematic from the start, it's a reason to think (likely, there will be issues in the future as well).
- Capable of correctly registering an autonomo so that there are no fines or problems.
- Properly registers with both the social security system and the tax office (during autonomo registration).
- Does not require providing [your personal digital certificate](#providing-a-digital-certificate-to-the-gestor)
  (instead, uses their own digital certificate to file reports and for other operations).
- Comfortable communication channels (usually email, WhatsApp).
- Periodically provides reports so that you know how much tax you will need to pay and how much money to keep in your
  account.
- Handles communication with all government agencies directly.
- Monitors notifications from the tax office and other government bodies.
- Has [insurance in case of their own mistake](#gestors-liability).
- Treats colleagues with respect and does not claim to be "the best of the best", belittling others.

**Gestors from the [list of reliable gestors](#reliable-gestors) fully meet all the criteria described.**
