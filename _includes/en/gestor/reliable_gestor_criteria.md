## Criteria for a reliable gestor

When searching for a gestor, always ask if they meet all the criteria described below. If they do not meet any of the
criteria, I recommend looking for another specialist.

- Adequate communication and prompt response to requests. It sounds basic, but if your communication is slow and
  problematic from the start, it's a reason to think (likely, there will be issues in the future as well).
- Capable of correctly registering an autonomo/SL so that there are no fines or problems.
- Properly registers with both the social security system and the tax office (during autonomo registration).
- Ideally, they should not require the use of your personal digital certificate. If your gestor needs your digital
  certificate, **make sure to read** the section
  on [providing a digital certificate to a gestor](#providing-a-digital-certificate-to-the-gestor).
- Comfortable communication channels (usually email, WhatsApp).
- Periodically provides reports so that you know how much tax you will need to pay and how much money to keep in your
  account.
- Handles communication with all government agencies directly.
- Monitors notifications from the tax office and other government bodies.
- Has [insurance in case of their own mistake](#gestors-liability).
- Treats colleagues with respect and does not claim to be "the best of the best", belittling others.

Additionally, I recommend asking the gestor about their past problems and errors with clients. If the gestor says, "I’ve
never had any problems, and we’ve never made mistakes," there are two possibilities: either the gestor is lying, or they
lack experience. Only those who do nothing avoid mistakes, so it's essential to learn how the gestor corrected their
errors and what compensation they offered to their clients.

**Gestors from the [list of reliable gestors](#reliable-gestors) fully meet all the criteria described.**
