## Creating an invoice (gestor)

If you will be issuing invoices in currencies other than the euro, read about [invoice currency](#invoice-currency).

To create invoices, your gestor will provide you with a template or recommend a service for generating them. If using a
template, you need to fill in your data (e.g., service cost and date) before sending the invoice to your clients. It
is better to put your gestor in a copy of email when you send invoice to clients. After receiving the invoice, the 
gestor will submit the necessary reports to the tax authorities.
