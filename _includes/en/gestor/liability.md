## Gestor's liability

A good [gestor](#reliable-gestors) should have liability insurance in case, for example, they make a mistake in reporting. If this
mistake leads to financial damage (e.g. fines), the insurance should cover the damage. Such insurance may include a
deductible (around 200-300 euros). Therefore, in practice, a responsible gestor, if they make a mistake that causes
minor damage (within 200-300 euros), will simply cover this damage out of their own pocket.

Before starting collaboration, be sure to ask the gestor to provide the policy number of their insurance (if they have
one). Examples can be found in the [reliable gestors section](#reliable-gestors).
