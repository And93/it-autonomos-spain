### Release notes - v4.1 (18/12/2024)

The last update of the year, on which I worked for more than two months. This time, some key sections have been
significantly reworked. The update includes about 60 commits (excluding merge commits, naturally).

**Bank account for autónomo**

This section has become quite large, but now it answers **all questions** (why a Spanish account is needed, where it is
better to receive payments, a special account for autónomo, bank selection, how to open an account, receiving payments
in USD and EUR, Modelo 036 for the bank, and more). After reading it, there should be no remaining questions.

**Mortgage for autónomo**

I recently wrote about this, but in case you missed it, a detailed article (15 pages) has been added about my personal
experience obtaining a mortgage in Spain (after 8 months as an autónomo). The entire process step-by-step, with details
about my mistakes and recommendations.

**Seguridad Social and the risk of losing the Seguridad Social discount**

I wrote in detail about the deductions for SS (how much should be deducted, when), as well as instructions for what to
do if, for some reason, funds were not deducted (how to check, how to pay). Additionally, it covers the first-year
discount and the possibility of extending it.

**List of reliable gestors**

Previously, there was only one gestor in the list; now, there are more. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find
verified and qualified gestors that can be confidently recommended to someone. I would appreciate it if you share the
contact of someone you trust.

**Other updates**

Some old sections have been improved and new ones added:

- Autónomo registration guide
- Tax deductions and benefits
- IRPF
- Creating an invoice
- Invoice date
- Invoice currency
- Problems with gestors
- Rent deductions from taxes
- Many minor and cosmetic improvements

Taking the opportunity (because I rarely write), I wish everyone happy upcoming holidays! 🎄☃️🎅
