## After registration (mandatory)

1. Obtain an electronic certificate (or Cl@ve PIN)
    - This can be done at any time, even before registering as an autónomo (but it's better not to delay).
    - An electronic certificate can be obtained in several ways. I did it here, for
      free: [https://certificadoelectronico.es/](https://certificadoelectronico.es/){:target="_blank"} (it took a few
      minutes, and I didn't have to go anywhere).
      This certificate has the same legal force as a certificate issued by FNMT. If you need it urgently, you can pay
      extra
      on this site for express service, and the certificate will be made the same day.
    - Cl@ve PIN is easiest to obtain when you already have an electronic certificate. Cl@ve PIN is not mandatory, but I
      think it might be more convenient to use some services in Spain with it. I have it.
2. Check that the correct IBAN of the account from which payments for Seguridad Social will be debited is indicated on
   the Seguridad Social portal.
    - [Tesorería General de la Seguridad Social](https://portal.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/importass/importass/bienvenida){:
      target="_blank"} (ver tus datos de autónomo -> Domiciliación bancaria)
    - If you have a gestor, they should do it for you.
3. Download Modelo 036
   [according to this instruction](https://www.xolo.io/es-en/faq/xolo-spain/category/get-started/article/i-am-already-registered-as-self-employed-where-can-i-find-my){:
   target="_blank"}.
    - If you have a gestor, you can ask them to do it.
4. Go to your bank and provide Modelo 036.
    - I went to the branch and sent the manager the Modelo 036 by email, but some prefer to print it out
      and bring it in paper form.
    - This needs to be done so that the bank records that payments related to autónomo activities will be credited to
      your bank account.
    - If this is not done, there is a risk that the account will be blocked (there have been cases shared in the chat).
    - Sometimes the manager may not want to enter your Modelo 036 data into the banking system (for example, they might
      say – come to me when you have your first payment as autónomo). In this case, you need to insist that the manager
      does it right away.
    - In some banks, this can be done online, so if you don't want to go, find out from the bank's support how this can
      be done. My advice is to go if you have the opportunity.
5. [Check the validity of your EU VAT number](#checking-the-validity-of-the-eu-vat-number).
    - If you have a gestor, they should do this for you.
6. [Create a client in the Xolo dashboard](#creating-a-client).
7. [Upload invoices to the Xolo dashboard](#tax-deductions-and-benefits) that you want to deduct from taxes (this will
   need to be done regularly). If you do not plan to deduct anything, then you do not need to upload anything.
8. [Create an invoice in the Xolo dashboard](#how-to-create-an-invoice-in-xolo) (this will need to be done regularly).
