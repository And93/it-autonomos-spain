## After registration (mandatory)

1. [Obtain a digital certificate](#obtaining-a-digital-certificate).
2. Check that the correct IBAN of the account from which payments for Seguridad Social will be debited is indicated on
   the Seguridad Social portal.
    - [Tesorería General de la Seguridad Social](https://portal.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/importass/importass/bienvenida){:
      target="_blank"} (ver tus datos de autónomo -> Domiciliación bancaria)
    - If you are collaborating with a gestor, they should do this for you.
3. Download Modelo 036
   [according to this instruction](https://www.xolo.io/es-en/faq/xolo-spain/category/get-started/article/i-am-already-registered-as-self-employed-where-can-i-find-my){:
   target="_blank"}.
    - If you are collaborating with a gestor, they should do this for you.
4. Go to your bank and provide Modelo 036.
    - I went to the branch and sent the manager the Modelo 036 by email, but some prefer to print it out
      and bring it in paper form.
    - This needs to be done so that the bank records that payments related to autónomo activities will be credited to
      your bank account.
    - If this is not done, there is a risk that the account will be blocked (there have been cases shared in the chat).
    - Sometimes the manager may not want to enter your Modelo 036 data into the banking system (for example, they might
      say – come to me when you have your first payment as autónomo). In this case, you need to insist that the manager
      does it right away.
    - In some banks, this can be done online, so if you don't want to go, find out from the bank's support how this can
      be done. My advice is to go if you have the opportunity.
5. [Check the validity of your EU VAT number](#checking-the-validity-of-the-eu-vat-number).
    - If you are collaborating with a gestor, they should do this for you.
6. [Create a client in the Xolo dashboard](#creating-a-client).
    - If you are collaborating with a gestor, skip this step.
7. [Learn to manage tax deductions](#tax-deductions-and-benefits).
8. Learn to create invoices.
    - [Instructions for Xolo](#how-to-create-an-invoice-in-xolo).
    - If you are collaborating with a gestor, they will provide you with their own instructions.
